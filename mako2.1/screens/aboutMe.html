						<strong>Curious things:</strong>	
							<p> Since I was for like 7 months living in the USA with a lot people of over the world, I learned some Japanese since It's really easy to learn for someone who speaks Spanish as a Native Language.</br>
							So my introduction in Japanese would be like... </br> </br>
							こんにちは! 友達、私はJulianです。どうぞよろしく (Hello Friends!, my name is Julian, nice to meet you).
 							</br>	</br>
 							Maybe someday I would study more Japanese, since it's fun and it's not that difficult, and I rather to learn Japanese than Java....
